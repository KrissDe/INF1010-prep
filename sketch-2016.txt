/* DOUBLY LINKED LIST

Node next, Node previous, Node a;

1a) How many objects are there in the picture?
1b) How many different types are there?
1c) How many variables are there in the picture?
             fields
             
- a, neste, forrige
- n1.neste, n1.

2. Implement method void swap(Node n) such that being called swap(a)
swaps node a points at with node a.next. In the picture there are 2 middle 
node objects that are coloured more grey. You can assume that there is a 
node before and a node after these 2 nodes that need to be swapped.

/* Linked list has a list head and list tail. Data structure when we create 
a new scope is in the picture.

3. Implement classes LinkedLists, HeadNode, TailNode and Node with class
variables and constructors such that scope state will be the same as in the 
picture when we have just created an empty scope, jf.main-method in task 9.
+

4. Pay attention to how the method compareTo() is defined in Node and that 
we have defined this method in this scope in order to compare nodes.
Implement method compareTo() in HeadNode.
+

5. Implement method compareTo() in TailNode.
+

6. Variable previous in the list tail must always point to the 
node at the back. It must point to list head when scope is empty.
Implement method insertTail in the scope such that the new object will be inserted
at the back. This method must not be recursive.
++

7. Pay attention to how the insertOrdered is defined in the scope. It calls the recursive
insert-method in the list head. Complete the classes HeadNode, TailNode and Node with the 
recursive method insertOrdered where it's required. Make it clear in the answer what method 
belongs to what class.

8. Implement method getFromFront in the class LinkedLists such that the first node 
(not the list head) is removed and the object obj points to is returned to where it's been
called. If the list is empty the method must throw exception.

9. Draw data structure that will be created by main-methof in the program sketch. In addition
to the objects inserted you must draw the list head and list tail.

10. Since list head and list tail don't need obj-variable and list tail doesn't need
next-pointer, we want to remove these variables from AbstrNode. After that we will have a class
that can be defined as interface. Let us call it as Elem since it's an interface for all the list 
elements (nodes and list ends). Implement interface and classes HeadNode, TailNode 
and Node once more. You don't need to write methods that are not being changed.

*/







/* KLASSES, INTERFACE AND INHERITANCE

13. Define classes and interfaces that represent the hierarchy in the picture. Definitions
must be empty, ie.there must be empty between { }. There must be only classes and interfaces that 
are in the picture. Write all interfaces first, followed by abstract classes. In the end write all the
non-abstract classes in alphabetical order. 1 definition per line.

14a. How many different objects can be created?
14b. How many methods is it possible to call in the object of class B when we know that 
Object has 11 methods and classes don't have their own methods and that all interfaces in the hierarchy/program
have 2 methods each, all with different signatures?
14c. How many methods are available in the object of class G?
14d. How many methods is it possible to call from variable ia after assignment in the line 8 of the program?

      public class Mainclass{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	    C c = new E();
	    IC ic = c;
	    IBD ibd = c;
	    Object o = new B();
	    IA ia = (IA) o;
	    ic = (IC) o;
	    A a = (C) ic;
	    E e = new A();
	    IBD ibd = (IBD) a;
	    a = (B) o;
	    c = new C();
	}
      }

      
15. Remove sentences that give errors either during compilation or execution. Write the main-method once more 
without error sentences.

16. Draw data structure the way it is right before the main-method finishes execution. You don't need to draw 
variables that have value null or objects that are not being pointed to/referred by variables.

/* SORT TEXT STRINGS

We have a file with 390 000 words(text strings) that we will sort, ie. order in the alphabetical(ascending) order.
To check if the word is alphabetically larger or smaller than the other word we will use method compareTo()
from the class String.
A sketch of the algorithm of the approach where you end with the linked list where all the words are ordered(you will not 
program this non-parallell algorithm):
-first we create a String[] that has place for 390 000 words. Array will be filled from the file with the name 
manywords with help of completed method String[] readWordsFromFile(String fileName)
-then we create a scope of class LinkedLists from the previous task and put 10 000 words from the array into it such that they will be 
ordered. We use insertOrdered for that.
-We do it 39 times and each time we have filled the new scope with 10 000 words from the array, we merge them together with the resulting 
scope to a new resulting scope.
In the end we have a resulting scope with 390 000 words.

Pay attention to that we only use an array with words as temporary container. We use scopes both for sorting and merging. For merging of 2 scopes 
we use method merge that is partially completed:

      LinkedLists<String> merge(LinkedLists<String> a, LinkedLists<String> b){
	//merge ordered lists a and b together to the new ordered list c
	
	LinkedLists<String> c = new LinkedLists<String>();
	String fromA = a.getFromFront();
	String fromB = b.getFromFront();
	while(fromA != null && fromB != null){
	  if(fromA.compareTo(fromB) <= 0){
	    c.insertTail(fromA);
	    fromA = a.getFromFront();
	  }else{
	    c.insertTail(fromB);
	    fromB = b.getFromFront();
	  }
	}
	
	// what do we know about the lists a and b here?
	// some code must be put in here as exercise 11b 
      }

      
      
11a. What do we know about the lists a and b after the while-loop in the method merge?
11b. Complete method merge.

12. Implement main-method that uses threads to parallellize insertion sort and merging. You can but not obliged to use wait()/notify
in this task. But both insertion in the linked lists and merging must be executed in parallell.
