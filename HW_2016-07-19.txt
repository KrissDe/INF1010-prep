- move all the files related to our lessons to a dedicated directory (it will probably be a repo)

- https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-two-linked-lists:
  implement a stand-alone program (add code to read the list from stdin and call
  the comparison method)
- implement CompareLists in a different way (lists are equal iff elements at some position are equal)
- investigate Oppgave5.java, comment lines and write down questions
 
- https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/linked-lists/difficulty/all/page/1:
  - update the stand-alone program with methods for all the tasks that are done
    - class LinkedList {
	Node head;
	public void insert(int data, int position) {
	  ...
	}
	
        public void compare(LinkedList other) {
	  ...
	}
        
      }
      
      public class Main {
	main() { // test LinkedList
	  read the list 1
	  read the list 2
	  
	  list1.insert(10, 1);
	  if (list1.compare(list2)) { print ... }
	  
	}
      }
      
  - implement at least 4 tasks among the 7 remaining ones
